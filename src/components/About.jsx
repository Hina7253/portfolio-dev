              Hello! I’m Hina Kumari, a curious mind with a passion for technology and problem-solving. Currently, I’m pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Applications, where I’m constantly exploring new ideas and sharpening my skills in programming and software development.
            </p>
            <p className='text-white mt-4'>
              I believe learning is a continuous journey, and that’s why I always keep myself open to new tools, technologies, and concepts. Coding for me is not just about writing logic — it’s about creating something useful, impactful, and meaningful.
            </p>
            <p className='text-white mt-4'>
              Apart from academics, I enjoy experimenting with designs, improving my logical thinking, and building a mindset that balances creativity with structure. These qualities help me stay focused, adaptable, and eager to grow.
            </p>
            <p className='text-white mt-4'>
              My long-term goal is to become a professional software developer who can contribute to innovative solutions while continuing to learn and evolve in the tech industry.
